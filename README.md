This guide explains how to use the Calibrate V5.1 Decision Quality System, a tool designed to help you improve your judgment by tracking your predictions and analyzing the context of your decisions.
The core principle is: Know When to Trust Your Gut. By logging decisions with your confidence level and later tracking the outcome, Calibrate reveals if your subjective confidence matches your objective accuracy.
üöÄ Getting Started: Onboarding
The first time you use Calibrate, you'll go through a quick onboarding process.
 * Welcome Screen: Read the introduction to understand that Calibrate helps you find your "blind spots" in overconfidence or underconfidence.
 * Quick Profile Setup:
   * Typical Sleep Hours & Wake Time: Enter your baseline sleep data. Calibrate uses this to warn you when fatigue might be impairing your decision quality.
   * Life Context: Select your current life regime (e.g., Single, Career-Focused). This helps the system understand the typical stressors and contexts that may affect your judgment.
 * Complete Setup: This moves you to the main Dashboard.
üß≠ Dashboard: Your Command Center
The Dashboard provides an overview of your progress and key actions.
| Section | Purpose | Unlock Status |
|---|---|---|
| Status Banner | Shows total decisions, outcomes tracked, and active integrations. | Available immediately. |
| Context Alerts | Real-time warnings based on logged data (e.g., poor sleep, high meeting load) that may impair your judgment. | Requires Integrations (sleep, calendar) or manual check-ins. |
| Quick Actions | Log Decision, Quick Check-in, Integrations. These are your primary interaction buttons. | Available immediately. |
| Calibration Stats | Shows your Overall Accuracy and compares it to your confidence level. | Unlocks after 7 days of use and 5+ outcomes tracked. |
| Pending Outcomes | A list of your logged decisions awaiting an outcome date. | Available as soon as you log a decision. |
‚úÖ Logging a Decision
This is the central action in Calibrate. You log a decision before you know the outcome to test your prediction skills.
 * From the Dashboard, click Log Decision.
 * Decision & Prediction:
   * Decision Title: State the decision clearly (e.g., Investing in stock X, Accepting job offer).
   * Domain: Categorize the decision (career, financial, health, relationships).
   * Prediction: State what you expect: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
   * Confidence: Crucially, set your confidence level from 10\% (guessing) to 90\% (very sure). This is the number you'll be calibrated against.
   * Timeline: Set when you expect to know the outcome (e.g., 1 month, 6 months).
 * Evidence & Context (Highly Recommended for XP):
   * Evidence: Document the facts, data points, or reasoning supporting your prediction. Logging this awards Evidence Gathering XP.
   * Emotional State: Note your emotional state (calm, neutral, stressed). Logging a 'calm' state awards Emotional Regulation XP.
   * Reversibility: Note if the decision is high-stakes (irreversible) or low-stakes (reversible).
   * Consultation & Deliberation: Track your decision process. Research shows consulting 2+ people or taking adequate time improves accuracy.
 * Click Log Decision. The decision moves to your Pending Outcomes list.
Context Warnings (During Logging)
If you have integrations enabled, Calibrate will display Context Warnings on the Log Decision screen (e.g., warnings about low sleep or high meeting load). This is the system prompting you to adjust your confidence before you submit the decision.
üí° Tracking Outcomes (Crucial for Calibration)
The system only works if you close the loop by tracking the results.
 * When the timeline approaches, or you know the result, find the decision in the Pending Outcomes list on the Dashboard (or a dedicated "Decisions" view, implied).
 * Update the decision with the Actual Outcome (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) and any notes.
 * The system now compares your Confidence (e.g., 70\%) with the Actual Outcome (Hit or Miss). This data is used to build your Calibration Curve.
 * Tracking an outcome awards Calibration XP and Bias Detection XP.
üìä Skill Building and Progress
Calibrate uses a gamified Skills system to incentivize good decision-making habits:
| Skill Category | Action to Earn XP | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Calibration | Tracking a decision outcome. | Improves alignment between your subjective confidence and objective accuracy. |
| Evidence Gathering | Writing detailed evidence in the Log Decision form. | Encourages data-driven reasoning over gut feeling. |
| Emotional Regulation | Logging decisions while in a 'calm' emotional state. | Highlights the benefit of rational, non-stressed decision-making. |
| Pattern Recognition | Consistent Quick Check-ins over time. | Helps the system (and you) spot correlations between daily context (mood, sleep) and accuracy. |
| Context Awareness | Using Integrations (sleep, calendar) to inform the decision context. | Encourages using external, objective data for better self-awareness. |
‚öôÔ∏è Integrations & Privacy
Access this view by clicking the Settings button in the main header.
 * Integrations: Connect external data sources (like Sleep, Calendar, Activity).
   * Benefit: Connecting data sources allows Calibrate to provide real-time context alerts and more personalized Behavioral Pattern analysis. For example, syncing your sleep allows Calibrate to warn you when you log a 90\% confidence decision after a poor night's sleep.
   * How to Connect: Click Connect on any of the cards (e.g., Sleep Tracking).
 * Privacy Preferences: Calibrate is designed to be Privacy-First.
   * By default, your data is set to Local Storage on your device.
   * You have the option to enable Cloud Sync, Anonymous Usage Analytics, or Research Participation.
   * You can Export All Data or Delete All Data at any time.
‚ö° Quick Check-in
Access this from the Dashboard.
 * This is a minimal, 5-second log of your current Mood and how it compares to yesterday.
 * Benefit: Regular check-ins build the data needed for the Behavioral Patterns analysis, helping you correlate your energy/mood with your subsequent decision quality. Consistent use earns Pattern Recognition XP.
