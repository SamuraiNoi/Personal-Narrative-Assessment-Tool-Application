## üí° Why Use Calibrate?

### The Problem
Most people are poorly calibrated. When we say we're "80% confident," we're often right only 60% of the time. We don't track our predictions, so we never learn from outcomes. Our blind spots remain invisible.

### The Solution
Calibrate creates a feedback loop:
1. **Record** predictions with confidence levels
2. **Wait** for outcomes to unfold
3. **Compare** predictions to reality
4. **Learn** from patterns and adjust

Over time, you'll:
- ‚úÖ Make more accurate predictions
- ‚úÖ Better estimate uncertainty
- ‚úÖ Recognize when you're in familiar vs. unfamiliar territory
- ‚úÖ Understand your decision-making tendencies
- ‚úÖ Improve judgment in high-stakes situations

## üé® Design Philosophy

**Cosmic Aesthetic:** A dark, space-themed interface with purple/blue gradients, glassmorphism effects, and smooth animations creates an atmosphere of contemplation and clarity.

**Minimalist UX:** Clean forms, clear navigation, and progressive disclosure keep the focus on your decisions, not the tool.

**Privacy First:** All data stored locally in your browser. No servers, no tracking, no data collection. Your decisions are yours alone.

- AI assistant provides guidance, not professional advice
